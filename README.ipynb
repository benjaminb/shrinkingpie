    "# The Iterated Shrinking Pie Tournament Ruleset\n",
    "#### version 0:0:0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The shrinking pie game, derived from the Rubinstein bargaining model, has two players negotiate how to split a fixed number of points between them. Each turn they do not come to an agreement, the ‘pie’ (points available to be split) shrinks according to a discount factor. This project presents a ruleset that expands the two-player game to a tournament with three or more players negotiating in pairs. Notably, players have a new action available: the option to leave a negotiation for the prospect of striking a deal with a more amenable player. This may present a better model for real-world bargaining environments, particularly where players have multiple potential partners. Additionaly, this project offers software which implements the ruleset, developed for easy creation and testing of strategies and bargaining environments. The software is highly parametrized, allowing exploration of numerous internal and environmental factors that influence a strategy's success. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Players are matched in pairs and negotiate over how to split a 'pie' of 1 point. One player offers some split and the other player responds with 'Accept', 'Counter', or 'Reject'. If the responder accepts, then they split the pie as proposed. In the next round, the offerer and responder meet again with roles reversed and negotiate over a new pie. If the responder chooses 'Counter', then both players meet in the next round with offerer and responder roles reversed, but for both players the pie shrinks according to their respective discount factors. If the responder chooses 'Reject' then the pairing between these two players is eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules, In Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Players are randomly matched in pairs. Each match is called a \"table\", i.e. a negotiation table. If there are an odd number of players in the tournament then one player is randomly chosen to be tabled with two different players, so that all players have at least one table. At each table is a 'pie' of 1 point to be split between the two players. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "At each of these initial tables, one player is randomly selected to make an initial offer. The offerer makes an offer between 0 and 1 (inclusive), representing the **proportion** of the pie they are offering to the other player (the 'responder'). Specifically, the offerer's available actions are any real value in the interval [0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responder then has 3 available actions: accept, counteroffer, or reject (actions = { A, C, R}$). At all tables, the offerers simultaneously propose their splits and the responders immediately and simultaneously choose their responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responder accepts: both players split the value of the pie as proposed by Player A. The points get added to each players’ scores. On subsequent rounds, the this table is repeated with the roles reversed: the responder makes an offer $O \\in [0, 1]$ and the offerer responds with an action in $\\{A, C, R\\}$. In other words, the same two players are placed at a table with the responder becoming the offerer and the offerer becoming the responder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responder counteroffers: neither player wins any points and each player's discount rate shrinks by their discount parameter. In the next round the players are paired at a table with the roles reversed as in the 'accept' case (offerer becomes responder and vice versa), only now they are negotiating over the shrunken pie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Responder rejects: neither player wins any points and the players will not be paired together in the next round. If the responding player would be in zero tables as the result of a rejection, then in the next round they are randomly paired with another player, excluding the offerer. Likewise, if the offerer becomes 'untabled' by rejection then in the next round they are randomly paired with another player, excluding the responder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discounts & Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player's discount parameter determines how rapidly their share of a pie will shrink. At each table, each round that does not end in 'ACCEPT' results in both players' discounts applied to their potential winnings. Since players may be at more than one table simultaneously, each player has a discount **per table**, which decreases by their discount parameter each round that does not end in 'ACCEPT'.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player comes to a table by being randomly selected (either in the initial round or in later rounds), their discount factor is initialized to 1, otherwise their discount parameter is applied. I.e. players who arrive at a table because in the previous round they rejected or were rejected have their discount parameter applied; players who were randomly selected to participate in the table do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say a tournament includes 3 players, P1, P2, and P3, each with a discount rate of 0.9. P1 is tabled with P2, and P1 is also tabled with P3 (P1 is in two tables while P2 is only in one), and say P1 is the offerer at both tables, and offers both players 0.25. P3 accepts P1's offer, but P2 rejects. \n",

    "Since P1 and P3 still have a table in round 2, no new tables need to be generated on their behalf. However, since P2 rejected, there will not be a table with P1 and P2 in the next round. This leaves P2 'untabled'. So P2 is randomly paired with another player in the tournament. The tournament randomly selects P3 to play with P2 in the next round. P2's discount decreases by a factor of 0.9 but for P3 it does not. As a result, P3's discount this round at this table is 1 while P2's is 0.9.

    "### Game Parameters:\n",
    "The game currently supports these parameters:\n",
    "- Length of game: The maximum number of rounds for the tournament. The default length is 1000 rounds. \n",
    "- Random termination: allows setting the tournament to randomly terminate after a certain round, with a given probability. For example, random termination can be set to 0.01 at round 1000, meaning the tournament has a 1% chance of terminating each round after round 1000.\n",
    "- Discount parameters: A discount parameter can be specified for each player, any real number between 0 and 1. Players could all have the same discount parameter or players can individually have different discounts assigned.\n",
    "- Information Restriction: restricting the information available to players can simulate social networks, in which subsets of players symmetrically have access to each others' histories. Asymmetric topologies can be created as well. By default, the players have complete information. That is they are aware of all the actions that all players have taken in previous rounds (but not the current round). Additionally, they are aware of all discount factors, scores, and game statistics. Currently, the game does not permit responders access to the current round's offers at other tables. Information can be restricted by specifying which players' histories each player has access to. Players have access to their own history regardless. For example, if Player 0's information is restricted to Player 1 and Player 2, then when Player 0 queries the game history they will only receive records of tables where players 0, 1, or 2 were participants. \n",
    "- Noise: a noise parameter can be set, any real value in [0, 1], so that any player's response is randomly changed with this probability. If the response is changed, it is changed to one of the two other actions with equal probability. E.g. if the noise parameter is 0.01, and a player responds with 'Accept', then there is a 1% chance the response will be switched. If it is switched, then there is a 50% chance the response will be changed to 'Counter' and a 50% chance the response will be changed to 'Reject'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Development\n",
    "More game parameters can be developed to allow researchers the ability to investigate other environmental consequences on various strategies:\n",
    "- Information Delay: information doesn't become instantly available to players across their social networks, but rather takes a certain number of turns to propagate.\n",
    "- Table caps: in the basic version of the game, there is no limit on how many tables a player can participate in simultaneously, and no limit on how many offers they can make or accept. However, we may want to restrict a player to being able to make or accept a certain number of offers. This may more closely model negotiations over a finite opportunity. For example, a laborer in the workforce can take on one full time job at a time, so they can only accept one offer per time period and all else being equal, would rationally accept the highest offer. If other players represent firms, then they likewise may have a finite number of job positions to fill. \n",
    "- Cost of Doing Business: players must 'pay' a certain number of points each turn in order to stay in the tournament. \n",
    "- Elimination: players whose scores drop below some threshold are eliminated from the tournament.\n",
    "- Variable Pie: rather than every pie be 1 point, some pies can be larger than others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player of course has a score which is the sum of all points they have earned. Since this number is highly sensitive to the number of tables a player participates in (which itself is random), the game also tracks:\n",
    "- Average points per round\n",
    "- Average points per offer\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these statistics may be meaningful: average points per round perhaps speaks to a player's ability to profit by maintaining relationships, while average points per offer may indicate the player's ability as a dealmaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Development\n",
    "Additional game parameters being developed or considered include:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Important files\n",
    "\n",
    "- `agent.py`: defines the `Agent()` class. Subclassing `Agent()` provides a template for constructing new agents and implementing new strategies.\n",
    "- `agents/` directory: `ispt.py` will look in this directory for agents to instantiate when running the tournament.\n",
    "- `api.py`: defines classes necessary for running the tournament and exporting results. In particular, the `ISPT()` class defines several methods allowing agents to retrieve game information.\n",
    "- `constants.py`: various constants used by `api.py` and agents for convenience. E.g. `ACCEPT` is set to 0, the code for the 'Accept' action.\n",
    "- `data/` directory: default location where the `ISPT()` class will save graphs and csv output.\n",
    "- `ispt.py`: a script to instatiate agents and the ISPT tournament. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the game\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `ispt.py` sets up and executes the game. This is broken down into two basic steps:\n",
    "1. Specify what agents will be playing \n",
    "2. Set up the tournament's parameters and play\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying agents\n",
    "In `ispt.py`, create the list `player_data`. This should be a list of lists whose elements follow the form: `[agentName, [nameString, otherArguments]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `agentName`: the filename (without `.py`, and case-insensitive) of the module defining the agent\n",
    "- `nameString`: the name you'd like to give this agent. This allows you to set a different name for each instance of an agent.\n",
    "- `otherArguments`: Optional. If your agent's `__init__` function takes additional arguments, these can be passed here, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code exists in `ispt.py` to then instantiate and name all the agents specified in `player_data`, and storing these instances in a list called `players`. It then instatiates the game by calling `ISPT`, which has the following parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting parameters & playing\n",
    "\n",
    "First, instantiate the game by calling `ISPT()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`game = ISPT.(players, discounts=None, default_discount=0.9, info_availability=None, initial_scores=None)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `players=players`: list of agent instances to use as the players in the tournament. Currently coded to the list `players` defined above.\n",
    "- `discounts`: list of discount rate to use for each player. If specified, this needs to be the same length as the number of players. If not specified, each player gets the default discount rate below.\n",
    "- `default_discount`: if no `discounts` specified, all players get this discount. Default value is 0.9.\n",
    "- `info_availability`: dictionary mapping player id's to lists of player id's. Each key is then a player id, and the value it maps to is a list of the player id's the key id player has access to. If this parameter is omitted, the game defaults to complete information: all players can access all past tables.\n",
    "- `initial_scores`: list of scores for each player. If specified, the game starts at round 1 with these scores assigned. If unspecified, all players start with 0 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ispt.py` script then stores the game instance in `game`. All that's left is to `play`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`game.play(max_rounds=1000, termination_prob=(100, 0.01), response_noise=0.01, export_csv=False)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_round`: the absolute maximum number of rounds the tournament will run for.\n",
    "- `termination_prob`: a 2-item tuple. The first item specifies at which round random termination begins. After this round, the second item specifies the probability the game will terminate at the end of this round.\n",
    "- `response_noise`: the response noise parameter (see above)\n",
    "- `export_csv`: if `True`, the game will export the history of actions and scores in `tables.csv` and `stats.csv` to the `data/` directory after the tournament has ended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, graphical output can be generated by the methods:\n",
    "- `game.graph_scores()`: creates a set of line plots graphing the game stats over \n",
    "- `game.heatmap()`: creates a heatmap showing how players earned points from each other. Each cell displays the points that the 'row' player earned from the 'column' player. E.g. in cell (1, 2) is the amount of points player 1 earned from player 2. In cell (2, 1) is the sum of points player 2 earned from player 1. Since discounts may be different for different players, these two scores aren't necessarily the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating agents\n",
    "The ISPT supports agent duck typing: an agent can be any object that has: \n",
    "- a `name` attribute: the default name for the agent (string).\n",
    "- an `offer` method that takes a `table` as a parameter (signature: `offer(self, table)`) and returns a number between 0 and 1 representing the split the offerer makes to the responder. E.g. returning `0.1` indicates the offerer offering 10% of the pie to the responder and keeping 90% for themself..\n",
    "- a `response` method that takes a `table` and an `offer` as parameters (`response(self, table, offer)`) and returns 0 for 'Accept', 1 for 'Counter', or 2 for 'Reject'. Importing all from `constants.py` will import the variables `ACCEPT`, `COUNTER`, and `REJECT`, with the corresponding values already set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclassing the `Agent()` class inherits this structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defining agent strategies\n",
    "Any logic can be set in an agent's `offer` and `response` methods to determine which action an agent will take. The `table` object passed in will be a `TableRecord()` object representing the table in the game for which the agent must provide an offer or response. I.e. if an agent's `offer` method is called, it means this agent is the offerer at the table passed in, and the table needs to make an offer to the responder. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an agent's `response` method is called, the agent has the current `offer` and `table` passed in available for inspection. While `offer` is simply a number between 0 and 1, the `table` parameter again takes a `TableRecord()` object, which will contain information about the players at this table, current discounts, and so on. See **Getting game state & history** below for more information about accessing data in the `TableRecord()` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identifying players within the game\n",
    "Generally, each player is given an id number corresponding to the order in which they are passed in to the tournament, starting at 0. A player's id in the game then corresponds to their index in most lists of game stats. For example, if there are 10 players in a tournament, then at any time the game scores will be a 10-element list, and the 1st player's score is stored at `scores[0]`. The $n$th player's score is at index $n - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting game state & history\n",
    "Various methods have been defined (as `@classmethods`) that allow agents to query the current game state or the game history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ISPT.get_state()`: returns the `State()` object representing the game's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `State()` object has the following attributes:\n",
    "- `.tables`: a list of `TableRecord()` objects, representing each table currently existing.\n",
    "- `.num_players`: number of players in the tournament.\n",
    "- `.scores`: a list of cumulative scores. The $n$th player's score will be at the $n - 1$ index.\n",
    "- `.avg_score_per_round`: a list of the cumulative scores divided by the number of rounds.\n",
    "- `.avg_score_per_offer`: a list of the cumulative scores divided by the number of offers each player has made or received.\n",
    "- `.table_count`: a list of current number of tables each player is participating in.\n",
    "- `.cumulative_tables`: a list of cumulative counts of tables per round for each player. I.e. for each round, each table a player participates in contributes +1 to this count.\n",
    "- `.round`: the current round\n",
    "\n",
    "A `TableRecord()` object collects the results of a particular table between two players. Note that at the beginning of a round, `.offer` and `.response` will both be `None`. These attributes get populated as the round is played.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.players`: a 2-element tuple, the first element is the id of the offerer, the second element is the index of the responder\n",
    "- `.offerer`: the id of the offerer (available for syntactic convenience)\n",
    "- `.responder`: the ide of the responder (available for syntactic convenience)\n",
    "- `.discounts`: a 2-element tuple, the first represents the current discount of the offerer, the second is the current discount of the responder\n",
    "- `.offer`: The offer that the offerer has made (or `None` if offer has not yet been made).\n",
    "- `.response`: The responder's response (or `None` if responder hasn't yet responded).\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents can query the game history using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ISPT.get_history(players=[])`: returns the game's history of tables. The history is stored as a list of lists of `TableRecord()` objects, one list for each past round in the tournament. NOTE: if information restriction is used, then this function **automatically** filters out any tables the agent does not have access to see. That is to say, this function returns the full game history available to each player, depending on their information access.\n",
    "    - `players`: list of player id's for whom the agent requests history. Players not in the list will be filtered out of the return object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "For example, this code could go in an agent's `offer` method. It calculates and returns the average offer made out of all offers from players 1, 5, and 9. Note that it is possible they have not yet made any offers, so it includes a default return value of 0.25:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>history = ISPT.get_history(players=[1, 5, 9])\n",
    "offers = []\n",
    "for round in history:\n",
    "    offers += [table.offer for table in round]\n",
    "\n",
    "if offers:\n",
    "    return sum(offers) / len(offers)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return 0.25\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another useful call would be `ISPT.get_history()[-1]`, which returns just the previous round. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this `response` method that calculates the average offer that was accepted in the last round. If the `offer` passed in is greater than the average offer from the last round, then the agent accepts. Otherwise, it chooses to counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>last = ISPT.get_history()[-1]\n",
    "accepted = [table.offer for table in last if table.response == ACCEPT]\n",
    "if accepted:\n",
    "    if offer > sum(accepted) / len(accepted):\n",
    "        return 0 # or ACCEPT\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    return 1 # or COUNTER\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note once again that it is possible there were no offers accepted in the previous round, so a default return value is included.\n",
